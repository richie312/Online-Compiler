<h1>Dates of Easter</h1>

<p>The Christian holiday of Easter Sunday is a movable feast. It can occur on any date from March 22 to April 25. The date depends on the timing between the Paschal Full Moon and the spring equinox. It wasn't until the late 19th century that a formula was developed to accurately predict Easter's date for a given year.</p>

<p>Your task is to use this formula, also known as Butcher's Algorithm, to write a function <h5>"easter_date(year)"</h5> that will return the date of Easter for any year after 1600.</p>


<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>easter_date(1600) => "April 2"</ul>

<ul>easter_date(2020) => "April 12"</ul>

<h4>Test Cases:</h4>
