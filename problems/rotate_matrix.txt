Rotate Matrix Elements

Given a matrix, clockwise rotate elements in it.

Examples:

Input
1    2    3
4    5    6
7    8    9

Output:
4    1    2
7    5    3
8    9    6

For 4*4 matrix
Input:
1    2    3    4    
5    6    7    8
9    10   11   12
13   14   15   16

Output:
5    1    2    3
9    10   6    4
13   11   7    8
14   15   16   12

The idea is to use loops similar to the program for printing a matrix in spiral form. One by one rotate all rings of elements, starting from the outermost. To rotate a ring, we need to do following.
    1) Move elements of top row.
    2) Move elements of last column.
    3) Move elements of bottom row.
    4) Move elements of first column.
Repeat above steps for inner ring while there is an inner ring.

Define a function rotateMatrix(mat); which takes an argument matrix mat and returns the rotated mat.

Example Input:

rotateMatrix([[1,1,3],[5,7,6],[9,8,9]])

Output:

[[5, 1, 1], [9, 7, 3], [8, 9, 6]]
