<h1>Lexical order</h1>

Sort a sentence or group of words in lexical order. If any word is starting with a capital letter then it will appear first in lexical order and then words starting with small letters in similar terms.

Define a function which takes string as an input and returns output of list of sorted words in lexical order.

<h2>Example</h2>

<li id="input_1">Input: "hello Python program how are you"</li>
<li id="output_1">Output: [Python,are,hello,how,program,you]</li>
