<h1>Circular Ring</h1>

Write a function <strong>def circular_steps(n, m, list_ring)</strong> Steps required to visit M points in order on a circular ring of N points.

Given an integer ‘n’, consider a circular ring containing ‘n’ points numbered from ‘1’ to ‘n’ 
such that you can move in the following way, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> n -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...

<h2>Examples</h2>

Input: n = 3, m = 3, arr[] = {2, 1, 2}
Output: 4
The sequence followed is 1->2->3->1->2

Input: n = 2, m = 1, arr[] = {2}
Output: 1
The sequence followed is 1->2

Input: n = 3, m = 2, arr[] = {2, 1}
Output: 2
The sequence followed is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2
