Fibonacci sequence:

A Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers which first two terms are 0 and 1 and all other terms of the sequence are 
obtained by adding their preceding two numbers.

For example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
And the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!

Create two functions fib(n) which takes an argument n (n>=0; a positive integer);returns a output of series of number as mentioned in
th example.

if n = 8, then output should be list of the sequence; []

and function fib_seq(n) which also takes the same argument n and calls the above function fib(n) within, to generate the 
sequence and store it in the list.

Example Input:

fib_seq(5)

Output:

[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
